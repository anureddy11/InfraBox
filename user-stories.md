PoP- Point of Presence. This refers a Logical Data Center
Physcal DC - This is the Physical location where devices exisit. A Pop can have multiple Physcal DCs
PoD - These are clusters within Physical DCs
Spines - This are further sub divisions on a Pod. Pod can have multiple Spines
Racks- are the where we insert devices. Spine has multiple racks

User Story 1: View All Data Center Locations on a Map
    1.As a network operations manager
    2.I want to visualize all data center locations on an interactive map, so that I can easily understand their geographical distribution and access relevant information quickly.
    3.I want to filter data center locations by region (e.g., North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific)

User Story2 : Create New Sites and Update/ Delete Exisitng Sites
    1.I want to create new sites within the data center management system
    2.So that I can accurately represent the physical locations and ensure they are included in operational tracking and planning


User Story3: View Detailed Information for Each Data Center
    1.I want to click on a data center location and view detailed information (e.g., capacity, current status, hardware details, Physical Location, Spines, Pods, Racks)
    2.So that I can assess its current operational state and make informed decisions.

Exatly the same user stores for Physical Sites, Pods, Spines, Racks


User Story 4: As a Date Center Manager: I would like to visualize all the indivsual racks

User Story 5: As a capacity planner, I would live to have access to multiple report:
    1. Capacity by PoP, DC, Pod, Spine, Rack
    2.Expected power utilization by PoP, DC, Pod, Spine, Rack
    3. Balance across Spines, DCs for a PoP
    4. Devices live vs repair state
